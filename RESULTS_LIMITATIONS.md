# Results and Limitations

## Results

### Lane 2: Radical-Pair Spin Dynamics

We implemented and validated a minimal radical-pair model using trace-decreasing Haberkorn recombination combined with Lindblad dephasing. Numerical integration was performed using a fourth-order Runge–Kutta scheme for both density-matrix evolution and yield accumulation.

**Validation Checks**

The model satisfies all required physical and numerical consistency conditions:

- **Probability conservation**: Y_S + Y_T + Tr(ρ(T)) = 1
- **Survival dynamics**: Remaining population followed exp(-kT) exactly
- **Positivity and Hermiticity**: Density matrices remained PSD and Hermitian

These checks confirm faithful representation of open-quantum-system dynamics.

### Phase B: Noise-Assisted Sensitivity and Collapse

We introduced electron spin dephasing as an independent noise channel and swept the dimensionless control parameter g = γ/k_S.

**Observed Regimes**

Across Earth-field strengths (25–65 μT), three distinct regimes emerged:

1. **Low noise (g << 1)**: Baseline magnetic sensitivity
2. **Intermediate noise (g ~ 1-10)**: Noise-assisted enhancement, peak at **g_peak ≈ 3**
3. **High noise (g >> 10)**: Rapid collapse, sensitivity → 3% at g = 100

**Significance**

Maximal sensitivity arises neither in fully coherent nor fully classical limit, but at intermediate decoherence scale comparable to intrinsic reaction dynamics.

### Cross-Domain Test: Memory Substrate Comparison (Falsified)

We tested a preregistered hypothesis that Lane 2 diagnostics might reveal analogous noise-assisted peaks in semantic memory substrate.

**Experimental Design**
- Embeddings → density matrices (Hermitian, PSD, trace-1)
- 5 noise types: dephasing-like, phase-like, Gaussian, dropout, permutation
- Separability metrics capable of interior optima

**Result**
- **No noise-assisted peak observed**
- All metrics showed monotone degradation

**Interpretation**

The hypothesis of special linkage between Lane 2 quantum dynamics and memory-substrate behavior was **falsified** under preregistered test. Earlier correspondences were attributable to flexible pattern matching, not shared mechanism.

## Limitations and Scope

1. **Lane 2 Scope**: Minimal model (2 electrons, 1 nucleus, isotropic coupling). Extensions to larger nuclear baths remain future work.

2. **Noise Models**: Phenomenological dephasing. Microscopic environmental modeling could refine thresholds.

3. **Cross-Domain Interpretation**: Density-matrix representations of semantic data are mathematical analogues, NOT physical quantum states. Metrics treated strictly as diagnostic functionals, not ontological indicators.

4. **Consciousness Claims**: **No evidence found** supporting direct physical linkage between radical-pair quantum dynamics and memory/consciousness substrates. Such claims require independent, domain-appropriate evidence.

## Summary Statement

> This work validates a noise-assisted sensitivity peak and decoherence-driven collapse in a biologically motivated open quantum system, while explicitly falsifying a proposed cross-domain linkage to semantic memory dynamics. The latter negative result strengthens the former by clarifying the boundaries of applicability.
